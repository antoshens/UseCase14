Provide at least 2 example urls how to change locale in the app above

ChatGPT:
To change the locale in the "Culture-Specific Formatter" application, you can append the desired culture directly in the URL. Here are two examples:

United States Locale: If you wish to format your dates, numbers, and units of measurement according to the United States' conventions, you would use the culture code en-US. The URL would look like this:

http://localhost:5000/?culture=en-US

French Locale: If you wish to use French conventions, use the culture code fr-FR. The URL would then be:

http://localhost:5000/?culture=fr-FR

In these URLs, the ?culture=xx-XX part is a query string where xx-XX is the culture code. Simply replace xx-XX with the desired culture code to view your data formatted according to that particular culture's conventions.
